            <div class="content">
                <p>My name is Zane Wilcox and I was born in the United States. I reside in Mongolia where I work as a full-time English teacher. My wife and I are currently expecting a little girl in the Spring of 2025. I have lots of things that I enjoy such as playing all kinds of games with family and friends, and anything outside like camping and fishing.</p>

The people here have a lifestyle that consists of their native nomadic roots combined with modern day conveniences and technologies. The populaton is roughly 3 million whereas the horse population is 4.8 million and many of them are wild.
